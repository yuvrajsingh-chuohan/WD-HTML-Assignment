  <h1>Be Fit, Be You</h1>

  <p>
    "Be Fit, Be You" means living your healthiest life while staying true to yourself. Fitness is not just about
    muscles, it's about energy, focus, and mental strength. In this website, I share my personal journey of staying fit
    through kabaddi, daily workouts, and healthy living. I believe everyone has the power to change, to grow stronger,
    and to feel confident in their own skin. This is not just a fitness story—it’s about discipline, self-love, and
    believing in who you are. If you are ready to improve yourself and live better, then you are already on the right
    path.
